    "\n",
    "After fixing these, I was still getting an error, this time an error related to memory. Because of this, I lowered the batch_size to 32. Once I did this, the training started working fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### batch_size too low. Training was taking too long. Loss was reducing at a slow rate\n",
    "Even though the training was working fine, I noticed that the training was taking long (> 8h). I also noticed that I was losing time because I did not have enough epochs and was having to re-run the training over and over. There was a point where I even had 25 epochs and still did not get a loss lower than 3.5 (I got around 3.9).\n",

    "First, I played around with the sequence_length and dropout. Switching between dropouts of 0.3 and 0.5 didn't seem to have much of a difference, but switching between a sequence_length of 10 vs 15 seemed to have some difference. The lower sequence_length seemed to have better performance so I stuck with 10. This was based on the observation of what the loss would be for the first epoch (i.e. lower sequence_length had a lower loss score for the first epoch)\n",

    "Next, I did some research online and found that if there was quite a bit of data to train on, having more layers could help so I decided to go from 2 to 3 layers. Changes were not that noticeable or signifcant but I decided to stick with 3 since the timing was still about the same. I also tuned the embedding_dim to 200 and left the hidden_dim to 256 to see if there would be any changes. I didn't notice much changes but decided to leave it at this for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I wanted to do something about the timing so I tried increasing the batch_size from 32. After slowly increasing this, I noticed that the model was training fine with a higher batch_size. There was no more memory error so I increased the batch_size as high as 128. This was one of the bigger changes I saw, as I saw the loss rate going down faster and the timing of the model training to be faster. This change got me closer to the target of 3.5 loss. I also tried exploring with more epochs to see how many it could take to get to 3.5. The highest number of epochs I tried was with 25, but this still missed 3.5 by a bit (3.8).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I continued to explore changing / tunning the embedding_dim (between 100-600), hidden_dim (between 100-600) and the n_layers (between 2-3).  When I trained and saw that the loss reduced at a better rate, eventually meeting the target (with ~20-30 epochs), I decided to stop since the target had been reached.\n",

    "- Tunning the embedding_dim and hidden_dim between 100-600 also helped with the training of the model\n",
    "- I needed more epochs\n",
    "\n",
